# Custom LEGO Sets with Rebrickable API 🧱

Welcome to our project! We're using the power of the Rebrickable API to customize LEGO sets. This project is built with React and Typescript. 

## Project Description 📝

This project is all about maximizing the use of your LEGO sets. We're leveraging the community-driven database provided by Rebrickable, which helps LEGO enthusiasts find new ways to build models using the pieces they already have. 

Our goal is to allow users to customize their existing LEGO sets, search for parts that belong to a specific set, add other LEGO parts to the set, and save their customized sets.

## Open Source 🌍

This is an open source project. That means anyone can copy, modify, or distribute the project code, even for commercial purposes. So feel free to clone the repository, play around with the code, or even contribute to the project!

## Features 💡

- **Customize LEGO Sets**: Make your LEGO sets unique by adding new parts and pieces.
- **Search Parts**: Easily find all the parts that belong to a specific set.
